This is my non-rigourous attempt at making thermo dyanmic suppositions about LLMs and complexity.

"Who was Scheherazade (if Scheherazade is an AI)?"

If Scheherazade were an AI, yet Shahryar didn't kill 1,001 girls because of it, then who was Scheherazade?

Purpose: Explore the intersection of AI, storytelling, and ethics through the lens of the Scheherazade myth.

Methods: A non-rigorous exploration of thermodynamic principles in LLMs and complexity, leveraging llama3.1 (our Scheherazade) on a setup of 30 TFlops @ 300 watts.

Questions to Ponder:

Identity: Does AI Scheherazade have a distinct identity? What defines it?

Authorship: Who is the true author when AI tells stories?

Purpose: What would be the purpose of an AI Scheherazade?

Moral Agency: Can AI understand and make moral choices?

Narrative Intelligence: How close can AI get to engaging, interconnected storytelling?

Temporality: How would the concept of time work for an AI Scheherazade?

Adaptation: How can AI achieve dynamic responsiveness?

Closing Note:

Am I joking? You don't have the flops to tell.

P.S. At the end of every story, she flips a coin and logs it in Excel. And oh, it's n+1 nights, nerds.
